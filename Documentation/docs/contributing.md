When suggesting a new feature, make sure it has a clear use case and play nice with existing features. When making a [pull request](https://github.com/fluentscheduler/FluentScheduler/pulls), make sure to discuss it first in an [issue](https://github.com/fluentscheduler/FluentScheduler/issues).

We're cautious (and picky) about any changes to the codebase. When doing so, following its structure and code style is a must.

Avoid sending the library authors emails. Open an issue instead, discussing it in the open.
